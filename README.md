# ovc_fibroblasts
Code used in the ovc fibroblast project 

From what I recall,  the only useful file is ovcProjectCodeNeat and any files it depends on
Code needs to be cleaned further, but currently no anticipated future use for the code aside from 
running new data from ovc group through it one more time.
